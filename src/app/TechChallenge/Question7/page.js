    <p>I think this was a concise assessment particularly with the encouragement to use the App Router feature that is available 
        with Next.js 13. I had not personally had a chance to work with App Router and found it to be a worthy challenge from the 
        traditional use of Page Router, which I am more familiar. Overall, I think this was a good mixture of both customer response 
        examples as well as the Vercel platform.</p></>
