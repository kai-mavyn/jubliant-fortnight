    ⠀*“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”*
    What response would you write back?</h1>

    <p>“Hello Customer, 
	I am sorry you are running into problems getting this redirect to work for you.  I have tested a redirect on my own test site and can see our platform is redirecting as I would expect. `https://mysite.com/blog1`  </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Unfortunately, due to security protocols, I would be unable to access your project’s repository and add the necessary redirect code changes as you would need. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>To assist you get this working, I propose we setup a video conference working session where we can dive in together and figure out what may be happening. When would be a convenient time this week to schedule a 30 minute screenshare conference call? </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>I look forward to assisting you and getting this redirect working as you intend. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Best Regards,</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>-Kai"</p></>
